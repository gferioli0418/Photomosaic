# Photomosaic
The purpose of this project is to build a photomosiac using an input of pictures. I got the idea from the youtube channel The Coding Train(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnlAH1zDBDE). For this project I used Processing which is very similar to Java. It can be downloaded here: https://processing.org/download/
